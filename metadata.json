    "Description": [
        "The model uses invertible flow-based model for generating unique molecules with desired properties. The model ultimately generates molecular graphs. In this model",
        "the directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) is applied to construct classification models for identifying hERG blockers based on diverse datasets."
