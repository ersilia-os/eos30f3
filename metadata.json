    "Title": "Prediction of hERG channel blockers with directed message passing neural networks",
    "Description": "This model leverages the ChemProp network (D-MPNN) to build a predictor of hERG-mediated cardiotoxicity. The model has been trained using a published dataset which contains 7889 molecules with several cut-offs for hERG blocking activity. The authors select a 10 uM cut-off. This implementation of the model does not use any specific featurizer, though the authors suggest the moe206 descriptors (closed-source) improve performance even further.",
