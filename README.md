# Prediction of hERG Channel Blockers with Directed Message Passing Neural Networks

This model leverages the ChemProp network (D-MPNN, see original Stokes et al, Cell, 2020 for more information) to build a predictor of hERG-mediated cardiotoxicity. The model has been trained using a dataset published by Cai et al, J Chem Inf Model, 2019, which contains 7889 molecules with several cut-offs for hERG blocking activity. The authors select a 10 uM cut-off. This implementation of the model does not use any specific featurizer, though the authors suggest the moe206 descriptors (closed-source) improve performance even further.
